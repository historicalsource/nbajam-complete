NBA License Information/Justification -	5/5/92 - Mark Turmell

The reason we chose to develop a basketball video to begin with is because
of the huge popularity of basketball worldwide.  NBA players will compete in
the Olympics later this year for the first time and other Professional
basketball leagues have sprung up around the world.  The NBA even plays some
regular season games in Europe and Japan.  

The street/bar market for a basketball game is ripe.  Sports bars have
flourished in recent times with NBA games their main source of programming.

When I spoke to our distributors at the last show, I was told repeatedly to
design games for the street market.  Basketball games were mentioned often as
an example of a product they could sell.


What do we get:

1.	The license would allow us to use all 27 team logos as well as the
	NBA logo.

2.	The license would also allow us to include one superstar player from
	each NBA team.

3.	Access to existing NBA film footage.  (This will be spectacular)


How it would help cash box and sales potential:

1.	First of all, the NBA and the team logos will draw attention from
	both game players and operators.  The local operator could select
	default matchups appropriate for his city based on the popular
	rivalries.  The NBA logo and players will mean cashbox.

2.	This would be the first coin operated game the NBA has ever licensed.
	This would certainly reflect highly on WMS.

3.	The game players would be able to pick their two favorite NBA players
	to play together in this two on two matchup.  This would include
	all of the Olympians.  The permutations are many and this would
	certainly affect the legs of the game.  The audio for the game would
	be able to call out "Jordan passes to Barkley, he shoots", etc.  

4.	All existing basketball games, or upcoming basketball games would be
	bogus without the NBA license.  We know that other coin operated
	digitized basketball video games are being developed.  The decision
	on which basketball video to buy suddenly becomes a no brainer.

5.	All NBA arenas have advertising panels adjacent to the court which
	rotate every 2 minutes to show the next advertisement.  Roger is
	going to contact these advertisers, and with the NBA license, he
	should have an easier go of it.  This will help to defray NBA fees.

6.	The home game companies would scramble for the rights to our NBA
	licensed game.  Acclaim has already expressed interest.

7.	International sales would be greatly enhanced with the NBA logo and
	players.  Jordan is said to be a bigger star in Europe than he is
	in the U.S.

8.	The NBA has a division which edits together NBA footage and sells
	it on video cassette tapes.  These tapes have dominated the top ten
	recreational tape rental charts.  Sometimes placing 8 tapes in the
	top ten.  NBA fans love to see these athletes in action.


The charts I've included show the rising popularity of the NBA and the fact
that 6 of the top ten most recognized athletes are NBA basketball players.
Basketball is also the number 1 recreational sport in the U.S.  Chicago and
other cities have local 3 on 3 competitions in the summertime which draw
thousands of players.

A link with trading cards such as SKYBOX is also an intriguing idea.

We need to make this happen!

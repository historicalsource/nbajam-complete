
Summer 1992 Consumer Electronics Show Overview - Mark Turmell - 6/12/92



State of the Industry:


	The home game market is very strong.  The strongest it has been in 10
years if you factor in the PC games along with the cartridge games.
Traditionally, the games took complete advantage of the hardware they ran on,
and therefore it was difficult to distinguish between a "good" game and a
"poor" game.  But with the new 16 bit game consoles and better programming on
the PC platform games, the games are looking real good.  There are still alot
of bad games, but there is an equal amount of good games.  You could actually
distinguish between good and bad, and that is exciting and good for the
consumers in that market.

	I believe Nintendo will win the 16-bit battle with SEGA.  SEGA will
certainly survive and may even be a viable market for games, but Nintendo is
definitely the safer bet for software development.  Especially when the
Nintendo CD player is introduced later this year.

	On the Acclaim front, they are stonger than they have ever been!  T2
the aracde game is being developed for every system they support, and will
be one of the promotional games for the new SEGA gun to be introduced shortly.
(The Nintendo Super Scope gun seemed to be lacking software support.  Too bad
because it is pretty cool.)  Behind the scenes, Acclaim is trying to make it
easier to develop titles across several machines by first rendering a blueprint
of the games artwork and then handing over that art to the developers who will
then touch it up!  They have spent a bunch of money in this regard and seem to
be barking up the wrong tree.  With the exception of a Crash Test Dummie title
that will be a rendered looking game, I don't see what they can gain.  They
seem pretty confused.  Of course, Acclaim recognizes the need to jump onto
the CD-ROM bandwagon.

	George and Eugene (Ken and Wally too) viewed the SMSG (Matshushita) CD
hardware which can display live action footage in real time among other things.
George told me he was impressed with this wire wrapped unit, Eugene was more
cautious and didn't really believe the SMSG claims (Big compression ratios).
Big company, big potential.  On the main show floor Phillips was demoing a
mocked up version of their live action add on chip for CD-I using JPEG
compression.  If this is really the capability of future CD-I machines, then
it has a future, if not, CD-I will fall to another standard.  Regardless, it
was easily the most impressive display of full motion video and audio I have
ever seen coming off of a standard CD.  Nintendo has announced that they will


Some Hot Titles:


1.	SNES Mode 7 games:  (Mode 7 = screen rotation plus zoom)
	 a. Star Wars - Side scroller with Mode 7 hovercraft action.
	 b. NCAA Basketball - Court perspective followed behind player.
	 c. World Cup Soccer - Same
	 d. Mario Bumper Cars - Split screen dual player racing game.
	 e. Super Contra 3 - Side scroller with tons of images on screen.

2.	Paint Program - another product that will help Nintendo reach a more
	 diverse range of users.  People seemed to enjoy it and this will
	 certainly be another reason Nintendo will beat out SEGA.

3.	Star Trek 25th Anniversary PC game - 100,000 units shipped in the
	 first 60 days makes this a big hit.  Interplay also showed a game
	 called Vikings and a claymation game inspired by TROG.  Each was
	 well received.  Interplay is a very impressive company on the
	 cutting edge of the home market, we should keep track of them.



CD-ROM:

	I was able to see a behind the scenes demo of some SEGA CD games and
was most impressed.  They have licensed the old Hasbro interactive video tape
games and they have many others in development.  I feel the CD capability
will greatly enhance traditional games and will open up a whole other genre
of games.  Nintendo also has invested heavily in development of game titles
for their upcoming CD player.  I have friends developing titles for Nintendo
CD and they tell me it blows away the SEGA CD.

	Clearly, we need to have mass storage capability.  To compete with
the home games will become increasingly more difficult.  As more and more of
a market develops for CD games, the budgets will increase beyond what is
feasible for a Coin-Operated CD (or mass storage with great audio) game.  In
fact, I foresee a situation where we will license a home CD game for play in
the arcades.  Don't discard that thought!  If someone creates 5 million
dollars worth of cool interactive footage and we can display it in higher
quality and in a unique package (cabinet, etc.), it could be a winner.  I
also foresee companies scrambling to recoup there investment in live action
by licensing the footage to us.  Bargains will be had!


Interesting CD Titles:

1.	Night Trap - this Hasbro title will be packaged inside the SEGA CD
	box.  All in live action, the player turns on security cameras in
	each room of a house trying to capture vampires and solve the plot.
	The live action cost 3 million to produce.  This is definitely a new
	form of interactive entertainment that will blow people away.

2.	Sewer Shark - another Hasbro title where players fly through tunnels
	in first person, shooting rats and making turn decisions.  John
	Dykstra created the tunnels for this game in Hollywood.  Production
	cost for the tunnels and the live action (Actors) parts was 5 million.

3.	Citizen X - A game I developed for Hasbro which has only 15 minutes
	of live action and 100 hand painted background screens.  Players
	run around this traditional video game world and are occasionally
	interrupted by live action scenes which slowly reveal the plot.
	Production costs were less than 500 thousand.

4.	Batman - SEGA will have a standard cartridge also, but the CD version
	will show live action sequences from the movie, as well as have the
	real soundtrack.

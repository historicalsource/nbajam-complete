New additions to NBA JAM manual for new KIT software - 3/24/93
Mark Turmell - Ext. 485


Changes to existing manual:


1. More dipswitch options:  (All dipswitches default to OFF)

	- UJ2 switch #1:  2 player or 4 player KIT (More below)

	- UJ2 switch #3:  Show video clips at halftime or skip clips.
			  (We included this because there may be a reset
			  problem in the game during the dislay of the
			  video clips)

	- UJ2 switch #7:  Powerup test on/off - We have included this
			  option at the request of Lenc Smith to speed up
			  the board test on the assembly line.

2. New adjustment:

	- Computer Assistance:  The computer tries to keep games close.
	  We have determined that this causes more excitement and as a
	  result, higher earnings.  However, if the operator cares to,
	  he can disable computer assistance.  This may be desireable for
	  tournaments, etc.			  
		

Kit Instructions:

The KIT software allows the operator to select 2 or 4 players!  This is
of major interest to operators.  We should communicate this fact very
clearly.  Maybe we can even paste a big notice to the cover of the manual.

The operator must first decide if he is going to stick this KIT into a 
2 player cabinet or a 4 player cabinet.  The software will configure itself
based upon dipswitch UJ2 switch #1.

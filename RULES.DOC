NBA JAM INSTRUCTIONS

The game is a 2 on 2 basketball game.  Players select the
NBA team they wish to control.  Four periods are played, and
the winner is the team with the most points at the finish.

Red Button -	"Shoot" on offense, "Block" on defense
Blue Button -	"Pass" on offense, "Steal" on defense
White Button -	"Turbo" enables players to move faster and
		enhances other actions.  For example:
		White & Red buttons together = "Dunk".

Turbo strength remaining is displayed on the meters located

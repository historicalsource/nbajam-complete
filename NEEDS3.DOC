Open questions regarding NBA license - 12/10/92

1.	We would like the Stay in  School logo on video tape, similar to the
	team logos. (ie. Nicely shaded multicolor image)

2.	We would also like the NBA logo on video tape, similar to the team
	logos. (ie. Nicely shaded multicolor image)  I have seen it on ESPN.

3.	A document/tape which shows NBA referees making each type of call.

4.	Video footage of NBA cheerleaders such as Laker Girls/Lovabulls.

5.	Celebrity clips?  Can we use them?  Can NBA provide them?

6.	New NBA slogans, phrases?  Can the NBA put these on paper?

7.	How do we proceed in regards to the cardboard cutout on the cabinet?
	The Spalding ball/hoop cutout was great!  Cost, options, quantity?

8.	For the show, can we have a video wall?  Can we set up a small wooden
	court, and portable rim?  Can we have an NBA player show up to sign
	autographs?  We need to have monitors running which show NBC telecasts
	of NBA games, positioned next to monitors playing a tape of our game.

9.	Do we need authorization from NBC to show this footage?

	Can players make promotional appearances?  Can we use NBA propaganda
	materials at our trade show?  We would also like to ship the game
	with a nerf hoop and ball type toy.  Any leads?  We could also entice
	bar operators with free/discounted NBA material like banners, flags,
	or even discounts on NBA neon signs.

10.	We should include some NBA banners or similar stuff with the game.
	Tournaments?  Prizes?  Cardboard cutouts of key players?

11.	We will the ship the game with a poster for each location which
	depicts a ladder style tournament layout.  Any ideas?  Can we place
	an NBA logo on chart?

12.	We need some NBA material for our trade show hype.  Banners, player
	cutouts, flags, etc.  Several items are listed as free in the NBA
	merchandise catalog.

13.	We will provide a video tape showing every aspect of our game so
	the NBA can approve it.  Is there a correct procedure or time table
	by which they would like to do this?

14.	Now that the NBA has ironed out their differences with Jordan, can
	they get him in the game?

15.	Advertisements?

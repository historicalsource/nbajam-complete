NBA License - 7/8/92 1:00 PM



	The way I see it, Williams should want this NBA license.  The NBA has
been cautious about entering the European market, it's understandable.  The
NBA, it is believed, will grant franchises and expand into Europe within the
next few years.  Acclaim had to wait a year before being granted worldwide
rights.  I believe we also would be granted those rights at some point in the
near future.  Besides, what was the breakdown on Arch Rivals?  The majority
of the sales were U.S. I bet.  On this game, we	could do a seperate version
for non U.S. markets in 2 weeks (More detail below).  But that's not the main
reason we should secure this license.

	The NBA is such a powerful license, I'm sure the company would want to
develop other NBA licensed games in the future.  The most popular basketball
format in the home is the One on One type game with the hoop in the middle of
the screen, we chose the TV broadcast look, but an equally exciting product
could be developed using the other perspective.  That product could be a
Street Fighter type challenge between any 2 NBA superstars, winner stays on
the machine.  Or we could develop a game around just one superstar.  Electronic
Arts and Acclaim both have followed their initial NBA offerings with sequel
products.  We don't have to follow it up right away.  We have new mass storage
hardware on the horizon, an NBA title which had the stars talking to the players
and appearing in windows is an obvious followup.  All of the NBA film footage
could be used in a mass storage type game.  Our game looks incredible now,
but if we had an NBA license going in, and were using the mass storage hardware,
the game would be amazing.  Our followup game wouldn't even have to be a video.
It could be for a redemption game, or pinball.  We just have to build that
relationship with the NBA.

	We've spent several months pursuing and educating the NBA.  The NBA
obviously has decided to grant a license to the coin-op market.  If we walk,
another coin-op company is sure to step in and snatch up the license for a
series of products.  This would of course, make all other basketball games
look retro.

	I have to believe the NBA would want us to market the game in Europe.
They are just being cautious, it is their history with Acclaim and E.A.  We
have the chance here to align ourselves with what I believe is the single most
powerful license available.  The NBA is so strong, I just know this is not a
one game deal.  Six months from now, if we tell the NBA we have 2,000 orders
for the game in Europe, would they say no?  We are so close...


Non U.S. non NBA version would require:

1. New side cabinet, marquee, and control panel artwork
2. Change/remove NBA and team logo artwork from game art
3. Change player names in game
4. Any special NBA footage displayed in a window

What we need from the NBA license & general questions - 8/26/92


Items we need and questions about them:

1.	We need two players from each team!  The game is a two on two full
	court game where the players can select the NBA team they wish to
	control.  Are some players off limits?  Can we get quality photos of
	the players who are chosen?  Can we get video tape footage (Hi-8?) of
	these players in action for our pop up windows?  Olympic footage OK?
	Can we use footage from the existing NBA Entertainmet video tape
	titles?

2.	We need good source material for team logo. (8x11 size okay)

3.	Access to some players to get video tape footage and also audio
	would be a plus.

4.	We would like to use the NBA slogans.  Both speech, and in text form.
	Is this okay?

5.	License to Michael Jackson's current song JAM which is on a current
	NBA Chicago Bulls tape.  Is there any theme music the NBA owns or has
	already licensed?

6.	We need some NBA material for our trade show hype.  Banners, player
	cutouts, flags, etc.  Several items are listed as free in the NBA
	merchandise catalog.

7.	Up to date rosters would be nice.


Other items we would like and more questions:

1.	How about the titles "NBA Jam" or "NBA Showtime"?

2.	Will the NBA need to approve any portion of the game?  What is the
	procedure?

3.	Can we use coaches names or likenesses?

4.	Exterior photographs of NBA arenas.  Can we use the names, etc?

5.	We would like to have a professional announcer call the game play.
	Can the NBA help us?  We just need an announcer such as Marv Albert
	to spend 30 minutes recording the needed player names and descriptive
	phrases.  (Ex. Mullin passes to Jordan, Jordan shoots, he scores)
	The computer could place the correct player name into general phrases.

6.	Can players make promotional appearances?  Can we use NBA propaganda
	materials at our trade show?  We would also like to ship the game
	with a nerf hoop and ball type toy.  Any leads?  We could also entice
	bar operators with free/discounted NBA material like banners, flags,
	or even discounts on NBA neon signs.  We should include some NBA
	banners	or similar stuff with the game.  Tournaments?  Prizes?
	Cardboard cutouts of key players?

NBA JAM Revision Information - 2/10/93
Mark Turmell - Ext. 485

Prototype games:

1.	250 protoype games were manufactured with PROTO 1.00 Image, Program,
	and Sound EPROMS.

2.	These were both Foreign & Domestic games.

3.	Two serious problems exist in those games:

	- When the game reaches halftime, video clips are decompressed
	  out of image ROM and from program ROM.  Approximately 1 out of a
	  100 games these clips decompress improperly and cause the game to
	  reset back into the powerup sequence (Attract mode).

	- Our second problem is that the game will go silent during game
	  play and usually recover at the start of the next period.  This
	  occurs approximately 1 out of 50 games (Once a day).  Management
	  was aware of this problem and felt that recovering the sounds
	  at the start of the next period was acceptable.



*****************************************************************************


Revision 1.00 games:


This was a complete EPROM change.  16 Image EPROMS, 3 Sound EPROMS, 2 Program
EPROMS.  The prototype Program EPROMS were 2 meg parts.  The Rev 1.00 Program
EPROMS are 4 meg parts.

John Mcaffer was provided a list of all the checksums for all Rev 1.00 parts.

Changes from Prototype games to Rev 1.00 games:

	- Video clip crash bug at halftime fixed.

	- Cheerleaders added.

	- Game play tweaks.


1.	x Rev 1.00 games have shipped.

2.	Two problems exist:

	- The game will still go silent approximately 1 out of 50 games.
	  The sound department has continued working on the problem.  We
	  have received some calls from the field about this problem.

	- The menu adjustment "ATTRACT MODE SOUNDS" is not functional.
	  Telling the game to play music/snds in the attract mode will
	  not work.  The games remains quiet during attract mode.


*****************************************************************************


Revision 2.00 games:


This requires both Program EPROMS (UJ12 & UG12) and the Sound program (U18).
Three chips total.

Checksums:
UJ12 - >b92d
UG12 - >6dda


Changes from Rev 1.00 games to Rev 2.00 games:

	- Sound board going silent problem has been fixed.  Added sound
	  board hand shaking.

	- Correct copyright/trademark messages installed  (Barbara Norman).

	- Full court shots go in less often.

	- Added attract mode sounds.  The menu adjustment now works correctly.

	- Cleaned up some funky USA pricing modes.  Example:  2 credits to
	  start, 1 to continue, 4 credits buys full game.

Memo received from Jonathan Hey regarding updated U3 EPROM - 2/10/93

*****************************************************************************


	   TO: 	JOHN MCCAFFER
	 FROM:	JONATHAN HEY
	 DATE:  FEBRUARY 10th, 1993
	   RE:  NBA JAM VIDEO GAME
	   CC:  MATT BOOTY, MARK TURMELL, WALLY SMOLUCHA


      SUBJECT:	SOUND LEVEL TWO (2) CHECKSUMS FOR SOUND ROMS
		REVISED	ANNOTATION 
      ------------------------------------------------------

	SOUND LEVEL TWO IS ISSUED FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:

	1. Fixed pointer bug in sound event list (which de-queued
	   oki samples)	

	      This fixes the problem where various speech calls
	   such as any announcer speech or sound effects such as
	   dribble(s) or basket sounds WOULD NOT be heard until
	   the sound board was reset.
	

	2. Installed hand-shaking (soundcall AA) between video board
	   and sound board .

		This fixes the problem of background music not being
	   played during game play.
	   

	
	
	REL2:

 (Tue Feb 09 14:00:20 1993) part: u3.pp  checksum: fc0a 
 (Fri Jan 29 05:45:48 1993) part: u12.pp  checksum: 304a } (same as SL1)
 (Fri Jan 29 05:46:29 1993) part: u13.pp  checksum: 9858 } (same as SL1)

Revision 3.01 (4/07/93) games:


This consists of both Program EPROMS (UJ12 & UG12).

Checksums:
UJ12 - >7860
UG12 - >c3c9


Changes from Rev 2.00 games to Rev 3.01 games:

	- The main difference is that this revision will be used in the
	  NBA JAM kits.  It supports the original 4 players or now just 2.
	  The operator will decide how to set up his kit.  The remaining
	  dedicated games that we build will be set to 4 players.

	- Changes the programmer's "back door" entry into the audit pages and
	  encrypts collection figures which do get displayed in this mode.

	- Fixes the ongoing problem of game resets which occur during the
	  display of video clips at halftime.  We found no specific bug,
	  but did implement additional error recovery for reset situations.
	  When we recover from a reset, it is transparent to the player.
	
	- New audits are displayed on the audit pages regarding the reset
	  problem.  They are:

		- Dogs:  	# of watchdog resets
		- Process KO:	# of lockups due to software failure
		- Clip KO:	# of successful recoveries from halftime
				  clip resets.

	- Fixes an occasional lost coin bug.  Sometimes during the attract
	  mode and/or gameplay, when a player inserts a coin, it will be
	  ignored!  We found a bug and fixed it.

	- New CPU drone code which kicks in for the more experienced players
	  or when the CMOS adjustment for drone difficulty is set higher.

	- Changed CMOS adjustment "Game difficulty" to "Drone difficulty".

	- New CMOS adjustment which turns off all computer assistance.
	  (Ie.  We try to keep games close, when this adjustment is turned
	  off, the software will not cheat for the losing team.)

	- New player powerup which turns off all computer assistance for the
	  next game.

	- New dipswitches:
	
		- UJ2 switch 1:  4 player kit/2 player kit - This switch will
				 turn the game into a 2 player only game for
				 operators who wish to place the kit into a
				 2 player cabinet.  Note:  If this switch
				 gets set to "ON" on a dedicated game, the
				 game will think it is a two player game with
				 team #1 using the player 1 set of controls
				 and team #2 using player 2 set of controls.

		- UJ2 switch 3:  Show video clips/Do not show video clips -
				 This turns off the displaying of video clips
				 during halftime.  (Due to their apparent
				 unreliability)

		- UJ2 switch 7:  This was a request from Lenc Smith which
				 when set, will skip over the powerup test.
				 I believe they wanted this so they could
				 manufacture the game more quickly.  (Though
				 less reliably!)

		- UJ2 switch 8:	 This TEST switch now works.

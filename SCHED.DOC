JOHN:

Give backboard frames to Tony.

Give fake a move with ball frames to Tony to strip and complete. (Been grabbed)

Analyze tape for any other clever offensive shots (For variety).

Grab swipes/steal frames
 - For each of the 5 directions.
 - 4,5 frames.

Block Shots in all 5
 - Just a straight up shot block with hands.
 - This needs to work as just an Arch Rivals looking block.  No swipe at
   ball!  If ball is in proper position, the computer will animate the standard
   block into a swat away block.  But normally, just arms up, arms down, land.
 - Possibly there are duplicate images for the squat portion of these jumps.

Behind the back pass
 - A couple of directions needed.  Whatever angles seem best.

Give work file to Tony.  The sooner the better so Tony can start incorporating
the new images.

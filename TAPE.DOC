Notes for Telemation:
        Insurance waivers, etc?
	Hi-8mm is the tape format.
	The camera will be at the same height for every shot.  We will need to
	 pan up and down for some jumping sequences.
        We have 3 actors.  Each actor will perform each action, revolving
	 back and forth.
        We are bringing extra cameras for full body shots, documentation.

Questions for Telemation:
	Saturday the 18th is reserved?
	Can we record the audio onto our Hi-8mm tape?
	Raising camera to 7 or 8 feet a problem?  On the dolly?
        Exact hours?  Overtime okay?  Night shoot?  Weekend shoot?  Costs?
        On setup day: mark floor with 5 lines and the direcion # also, layout
	 the track, area to paint?  Can lighting be done on this day?
        Length of track.  Same distance to actor when we angle camera?
        Explain the problems with 1.5 direction.  Tough to get chroma key
	 etc.  A different lens help?
        Time estimate to tape?  Should we have a goal setup going into shoot?
        Markers before any sequences?  Set up groups?
        Using a dolly a problem?  Length?  We need to see it.
        Need monitor hooked up so we can see what is being taped!
        Will monitor show what is actually being recorded on tape?  Mark off
	 square area on monitor?
	Dunks use locked down camera or dolly?  How much panning is needed?
        High speed shutter?  Wide angle lens?  We want no blurring and the
	 actors need to be well lit and appear dimensional.  Lighting needs to
	 be consistent for length of run.
        Swing from rim dunk?  Setup a fake hoop?  Suggestions?  Moveable 7-8
	 foot target for dunks would be good.
        D2 machine an advantage?  Costs?
        Are floor mats available for falls?
        Chroma key backdrop?  Ultimatte.  How much to paint, how high.
        When zooming in, we need scale Torso/Legs/Body the same each time!
	 This is very important.
        Towels available?  Water bottles available?  Spray bottle/makeup?
        Jack will dupe the tapes?  Special master tape?  5 copies?
        Call time for actors on shooting day?
	We need a monitor so we can hook up our camcorder and view the first
	 Hi-8mm tape that comes out of the tape machine.

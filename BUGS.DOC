Physics on push flyaways.  They need to choose proper flyback art, possibly
 no flailing while flying, turn collisions off, float up and skid on butt
 and get back up faster.  If pushed while shooting, the rules may be
 different.  Allow offensive players to push, sometimes a turbo pass will
 also push!  This is cool.

Players sometimes stagger when ball is inbounded to them.

Players can stagger themselves sometimes (after they have been flailed) by
 pushing their stick.

Goaltending can score 4 points for team if ball goes in hoop.

I saw the shot % numbers on the scrn, but the new crplate2 img was not on!

Ball gets stick in corners, nobody picks it up, everyone flails, ugly.  The
 ball can also slip off the side edges of the screen.

Elbows must toss players backwards like a push - no fouls called.

When players block a dunk & come down with the ball, they can't dribble.

Implement hook shots, layups, and when we get the referee art, implement
 the jump ball code.

Players can shoot jumpers from behind backboard & Ball goes through backboard.

We tryed this before and it wasn't smooth, but it would be nice if both
 side and upper arrows attached to player more accurately.  The Y is not
 checked at all.  They are fairly smooth now.  Check GND_Y in SCORE.ASM and
 stktop label also in SCORE.ASM.  Label stktop is the code which handles
 the arrows on top of the player's heads. 

Implement over and back rule at center court.  I have a hunch that this will
 have real bad ramifications on gameplay and we may decide not to do it.
 Is there a rough mockup you can do to test it?  There is also the 10 second
 rule which is supposed to force the offensive team across center court
 within the first 10 (Or approx 5 in our case) seconds.

Tweak dribble height at all distances.

Ball is behind player dribbling ball at bottom of screen.

Player legs get clipped at bottom of the screen.  Ugly.

Do you want to further tweak the boundaries for stepping out of bounds?  Both
 horizontal and vertical edges?

Heads seperate from body at rear of court when jumping.
 
We should figure out where to start/stop 24 second clock.  There are bugs
 right now that don't start or stop the clock correctly.  I will clean up
 the KIL1C code.

The screen scroller rules should be analyzed.  The scrn glitches vertically
 when changing vertical buffering technique.  I will check into that glitch
 since I messed with it earlier.  But the normal scroller rules should be
 thought out some more.

We may want to max out the vertical pan when the ball goes up to high.

The rim action is half as cool as it once was.  The ball goes half way
 into the net before bouncing off the rim.  It doesn't bounce around inside
 of rim, or bounce high enough above the rim.  The ball still gets stuck
 between the rim and backboard.  We should tweak this to make it  cool again.  

The in close bank shots could use a higher arc.

Increase the shot % approx 20% or so if team taking shot is losing.
 This adjustment should not show up on screen.  I bet this will be trasparent
 to players and keep the games tighter.  perhaps less than 20% on LONG RANGE
 shots.  If you don't want to make it a blanket increase of 20%, I do think
 the criteria should be distance not what the % would normally have been.
 In other words, if a player takes a 10 footer and a defender was totally in
 his face and the shot % reads 5%, I would still add 20% additional to the
 shot, however, if a guy takes a full court shot and the % reads 5%, I
 would only increase the chanve of going in to about 10%.  I don't think
 players would notice that.

Sometimes a player should fall down on his butt after taking a jump shot.
 Just for the variety.  Sometimes a jumper will fade backwards also.  I also
 think sometimes a player should drift in the same direction he was running
 when he took his jump shot.  This could be a slight drift but I bet it
 looks pretty cool.

You need to implement different size guys.  Including widths.

Live action sometimes flickers.

You had a good idea about slowing down the offensive team if they are ahead
 by 10 points.  We should do that.  I don't think players will notice.

Alley-oop shot!  Shoot/Pass at same time passes to top of backboard and
 causes teamate to leap up and grab ball and drop it through.  If he isn't
 close enough, ball banks off backboard.  (Possibly all three buttons)


FOULS STUFF:

Implement fouls.  This leads to many issues, among them:
 - We think foul shots should only occur 6-8 times a game.  And it seems
   that it would be most dramatic if when fouled, the player always makes
   his shot (Jumper/dunk) which creates a 3 (or even 4) point opportunity.
   There is so much physical contact in the game that we can call/create
   fouls almost anytime we want on shots (Jumpers or dunks).

 - We think pushes are cool and have changed our mind on what % of pushes
   should result in fouls/play stoppage.  We need to implement the chance
   but we'll have to tweak it.

 - Player taking a jumper who is touched by a defender (Most every play!)
   should fall backwards onto the ground some small % of the time which
   creates a foul situation.

 - Sometimes a defender who collides with a dunker should fly backwards
   with a bunch more velocity, this could be a charge.

 - More...


PASSING BUGS/TWEAKS:
 
 - Sometimes a pass hits a defender (Possibly when defender is jumping?) and
   I think you wanted the ball to bounce away.  Well, it does occassionally,
   but it does so at the speed of light!

 - Bug where receiver stops to receive a pass even though he has been running
   in same direction for a long time.

 - Overhead pass is glitchy.  Receiver should not jump as high, pass should
   be faster, and pass should fly into hands.

 - When receiver of a bullet pass originates off screen, that ball should have
   a greater chance of attaching to defenders.  But not if defender is close to
   passer. 

 - Try having pass trigger when button is first pressed.

 - When on offense but not in possession of the ball, and the pass button is
   pressed, the player stops and rotates toward teamate.  Nothing should
   happen when this happens, he should keep running.

 - Jump pass is glithcy, ball doesn't seem to originate from the ball carrier.
   You should slow-mo this to analyze problems.  Some dunks allow you to pass
   out of them.  What are the rules on this?  Sometimes the art is just to far
   out of sync (Dunk to jump pass) to allow this.

 - Implement the #3 direction dish off pass.  Player should be running, elevate,
   and dish off to teamate if he is above or below in a certain arc.

 - Implement bounce pass.


DRONES STUFF:

Drones seem to do to many head fakes, they also tend to shoot the ball
 at the end of the jump shot cycle instead of the peak.

At some point, we should all sit down and talk about drone logic.

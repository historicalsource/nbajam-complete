Open House Highlights:


1. Talk about new cabinet
	- Lot of problems with MK reported by operators
	- Natural evolution of our universal cabinet

		- Better security on back - padlock possible
		- Lower pc now has l-brackets - not glue
		- Control panel uses better hardware, hinged also.
		- Vault is more secure (Wood enclosure)
	
		- This coin door is now our standard coin door on
		  all video and pinball games.  It allows an optional
		  bill validator, and provides a larger vault.  This game
		  in particular begs for a validator since it is the first
		  video Midway has ever developed which fits well into the
		  street/bar market.  Especially because the game costs
		  $2.00 to play a full game.  In fact, we have bar locations
		  where 90% of the income derives from bills!  Historically,
		  our pinballs (our test) have derived approx. 15% of income
		  from bills!

		- We have now taken away the front access door.  The boards
		  are now mounted in the rear of cabinet.

		- We have listened to the operator.
		- This is an ongoing evolution.


2. This game introduces Williams/Midway new video hardware.
	- 4 times the amount of colors
	- Our first ever hardware scaling chip.  More realistic look for
	  players shrinking into distance.

	- Stays a step ahead of copy boards - (ie. new hardware)

3. The NBA license.
	- First ever NBA license into the coin op marketplace
	- We feel this is the most powerful license available today - bigger
	  than any movie, tv show, or other sport.
	- More powerful than ever imagined
	- All 27 teams, 2 superstars from each team
	- Universal appeal - young and old
	- Superstar athletes - year around visibility
	- Game debuted at NBA all-star game in Utah, we expect lots of
	  ongoing publicity from the NBA - tv shows, etc.

4. The game
	- 2 on 2
	- Game is factory set at .50 to start, .50 to continue
		- We strongly reccommend factory settings
		- Explain in depth the pricing
			- Show credit page
				- Point out 8 credits buys full game
				- No discount on this full game puchase price
			- Showing the balls at bottom
				- Buy up 4 periods - show the box fly down
				- Set full game to 6, clear credits, show
				  credit page, then visually demo how the
				  full game gets purchased for 6.
				  Game still would cost $2.00 if player does
				  not buy full game up front.
			- 90% of players step up and purchase a full game
			  up front.  That's $2.00 they offer up right away.

		- The entire complement of other pricing modes are supported
		  (ex. .50 start, .25 continue.)  And operators have told us
		  they can get away with higher pricing as well!

		- Explain operator selectable free game feature
			- Our tests show - keep the factory setting
			- Compare to SFII, MK etc.

		- Point out other adjustments (ex. time)
		- Once again, this is a time based game
			- Factory setting is about 12 minutes for $2.00
			- No matter how good they get, it still costs the
			  same amount.

	- YES/NO page
		- Explain stats & high % of people entering YES.  This tells
		  us that these people will be back - beat all the teams, etc.
	- Team select
		- Witness the more powerful hardware.  Look at these photos
	- An announcer calls all the play by play action.
	
	- Game start
		- We tried to make the game look like TV - check out the pan
		  of the court, the players scale accurately, they really
		  look like the real guys.
   	
	- Stop game in early stages

5. Bottom line
	- Highest earning coin operated game of all time - The company is now
	  advertising the game in this manner.  Mention Dragons Lair, SFII,
	  Virtua Racing, you name it.

	- The game is strong in all locations
		- Bars making $700/wk
		- Arcades making $2000/wk
		- C-stores making up to $1000/wk

	- As a matter of fact:
		- First game we have ever seen that actually increases in
		  earnings!  Never before have we seen this!
		- There is a learning curve.

   	- We think the game is perfectly timed
		- Witness Arch Rivals, we shipped in late spring - May/June
		  and continued production into the fall.  That was an
		  extremely strong game.
		- Basketball is a year around sport, June playoffs - Oct
		  opening.  Unlike other sport video games, we feel this game
		  will earn year around.
		- Another reason is the nature of the game: COMPETITION.
			- Oriental kids - similar to punch kick games.

	- We walked a fine line trying to excite (make look good) the novice
	  player and yet put some hidden features into the game for the expert
	  player.  There is incredible depth in this game.  Team matchups as
	  well as player matchups.

6. The company policy on kits
	- 2 player dip switch for kit

7. Ask operators about location
	- predict NBA JAM earnings and suggest pricing.

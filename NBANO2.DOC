Neil,

I understand you will talk with the NBA today, I just have a couple of
thoughts.

1.	What is their criteria for deciding if our (or other) product
	can be marketed internationally?  Based on quality?  It's success
	here in the U.S. first?  If the game remains loyal to the NBA rules?
	Are they concerned about how many would be shipped internationally?  

	If those are their criteria, we can win them over. We can address
	all those concerns.

2.	We're only talking about a couple thousand games out of the U.S.  If
	we agree to just the U.S. license, and tell them we are going to ship
	the same game minus the NBA logo into those international markets,
	would that sway them?

3.	They have our demo tape, Roger tells me they haven't viewed it.
	Would the quality of our work in progress sway them?

4.	Roger may have mentioned that coin-op games can get illegally copied
	and this may have caused them concern.



If they stay firm, could we get them to agree to look at the game in December
and then decide?  What process would they go through if they were to decide
to grant us the worldwide license?  Can we speed that up?  If they say they
want to wait until the U.S. games shipfor 6 months, could we manufacture the
international games at that point?  Can we get them to agree to U.S. and 
Canada at least?

Thanks,

Mark Turmell

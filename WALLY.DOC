Overall list of artwork needed - 8/26/92

In priority order:


1-

Finish grabbing Willie images.  Incorporate them into Willie4.  John C. is
 responsible and has a list of what needs to be grabbed.  (Less than 20 imgs)
 1 day
 

2-

Fix color on some of the images which are too bright or too dark for all
 Willie files.  Some images need to be rescaled also.  John C. is responsible
 for this and has a list of messed up images from all the Willie files.
 3 days


3-

Major touch up on all the shoes, hands, heads, trunks, fringing, and any
 flesh inside uniform.  Tony and John C. are responsible for Willie images.
 Double check the stationary imgs and #3 runs - they are most critical.
 10 days


4-

Finish grabbing all the Todd images.  John N. has a list of sequences needed
 and is responsible for all Todd grabs.  John N. is responsible for setting
 all the animation points and correctly naming each image.  John N. has all
 the Willie files so he can look at names & animation points.
 15 days


5-

Touch up John Newcomer's Todd images - nobody has seen the art but I assume
 some additional work will be required.  Touch up is expected to be
 similar to Willie touch up.
 5 days


****************************************************************************
									   
All of the Willie & Todd images must be completed before we move on!
These will be the first images to be locked to for ROM masking.

****************************************************************************


6-

New animated hoop/backboard/net.  Rim must bend down, net must swish,
 backboard must tilt correctly.  We must attain a video tape for reference.
 Tony to do.
 2 days


7-

Team logos for selection screen.  Hopefully we can get some good source
 material for help in digitizing.  All 27 teams needed?  John N. is 
 responsible for grabbing and touching up.

New Midway text for the flipped end of the court.  Text reads NBA JAM.

 John N. responsible for grabbing and touching up.  Tony could help if he
 has the time.
 3 days


10-

NBA logo on lower right court, and upper left near scorer's table.  Tony to
 do.  Need to isolate these red/white/blue colors from the rest of the court
 pal!  Because the court colors will change, but not the logo.
 1 day


11-
	
	Pal mods moved down.


12-

Put legs on blue guy torso in table2 img of file COURT.IMG.  Put us in crowd!
 Change the crowd to solve flip look and then animate the parts of the crowd
 with 5 or 6 animating sequences, some of which could be copied around into
 other areas.  Make bench players bigger and animate them, towels & stuff.
 Tony to do.
 5 days


13-

Get a few pals for court - Tony will have to modify the blending colors into
 the crowd!  Even tint the floor boards for variety.
 1 day


14-

All the team names printed out as one big image.  Like we already have Chicago
 and Detroit.  All 27 teams needed.  John N. to piece together and touch up.
 1 day


15-


Possible advertisements on scorer's table.  This includes the reflection
 down onto the court.  We need a few ads.  Tony and John C. to do.

 sure they work.

52 pals needed.  One for each player.  John C. and Tony to do.  Mark will
 reorganize the pal for easier range adjustment.
 5 days


19-

Title page - How about: Full screen NBA logo with full screen head shot of
 Jordan & other player heads crammed around the screen?  We want to show off
 our cool 256 color digitized heads!  Sixteen pals of 256 on screen at
 once!  People should look at this and say wow, graphics have come a long way.
 Maybe they'll even imagine that the on screen players are the real dudes!
 Other ideas?  John C. & Tony are responsible.
 4 days


20-

Video clips for playback.  We can do different sizes and can combine multiple
 players in one clip.  We should have more/larger Jordan clips than others!

*****************************************************************************



What we need from the NBA license & general questions - 8/27/92


Items we need and questions about them:

1.	We need two players from each team!  The game is a two on two full
	court game where the players can select the NBA team they wish to
	control.  Are some players off limits?  Can we get quality photos of
	the players who are chosen?  Can we get video tape footage (Hi-8?) of
	these players in action for our pop up windows?  Olympic footage OK?
	Can we use footage from the existing NBA Entertainmet video tape
	titles?

2.	We need good source material for team logo. (8x11 size okay)

3.	Access to some players to get video tape footage and also audio
	would be a plus.

4.	We would like to use the NBA slogans.  Both speech, and in text form.
	Is this okay?

5.	License to Michael Jackson's current song JAM which is on a current
	NBA Chicago Bulls tape.  Is there any theme music the NBA owns or has
	already licensed?

6.	We need some NBA material for our trade show hype.  Banners, player
	cutouts, flags, etc.  Several items are listed as free in the NBA
	merchandise catalog.

7.	Up to date rosters would be nice.

8.	Need approval of title "NBA Jam" so we may work on cabinet art


Other items we would like and more questions:


1.	Will the NBA need to approve any portion of the game?  What is the
	procedure?

2.	Can we use coaches names or likenesses?

3.	Exterior photographs of NBA arenas.  Can we use the names, etc?

4.	We would like to have a professional announcer call the game play.
	Can the NBA help us?  We just need an announcer such as Marv Albert
	to spend 30 minutes recording the needed player names and descriptive
	phrases.  (Ex. Mullin passes to Jordan, Jordan shoots, he scores)
	The computer could place the correct player name into general phrases.

5.	Can players make promotional appearances?  Can we use NBA propaganda
	materials at our trade show?  We would also like to ship the game
	with a nerf hoop and ball type toy.  Any leads?  We could also entice
	bar operators with free/discounted NBA material like banners, flags,
	or even discounts on NBA neon signs.  We should include some NBA
	banners	or similar stuff with the game.  Tournaments?  Prizes?
	Cardboard cutouts of key players?

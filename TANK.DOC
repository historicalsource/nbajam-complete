Re:	 Tank Game Information:


I found out on Friday that some of you may believe that I knowingly allowed
the tank game to be played in the attract mode.  This is completely false.
A software bug is what caused the problem.

The tank game was something that was being programmed on at the start of
the NBA JAM project.  The NBA JAM code grew out of that game.  The tank
game was always in NBA JAM, but it was disabled.  It was reenabled shortly
before we released the game.

All of the game powerups are triggered at one specific moment, which is just
as the court and players are first displayed.  It is here that the tank
powerup is also checked.  Unfortunately, when the attract mode displays game
action, the very same start up code is executed.  This was the bug.

I was not aware that the tank game could be called up during that moment
of the attract mode.  When we stumbled upon it ourseleves, about three weeks
after the game had shipped, we were shocked and the bug was immediately
fixed.  I should have stopped everthing at this point and discussed the bug.

It was at this time that we were attempting to release rev 3.0 software
which fixed the bug.  Unfortunately, we then had a delay in tracking down
exactly why some 2.0 games were resetting and some were not.  Of course,
this allowed more 2.0 games to ship, which worsened the problem.

I feel horrible about the bug and the resulting furor, but learning that
some of you may think this was no accident made me feel worse.  I may have
allowed this bug to get past, but I'm not stupid enough to purposely allow
kids to play for free.  In fact, in a related area, NBA JAM software allows
people to advance through the attract mode by tapping on a button.  I
discussed the pluses and minuses of this feature with several people in the
company before I elected to include it.  I was concerned that even this
limited amount of interaction would be detrimental to the game.

For the last month or so, I have been receiving approximately four phone
calls/messages a day from kids who are playing NBA JAM and are looking for
secret powerups.  I occassionally take the time to chat with these callers.
Sometimes I verify and/or tell someone how to do one of the games.  The
secret powerups have definitely spurred additional interest in the game.

I have never and would never tell someone how to get into the tank game from
the attract mode.  One of the individuals I spoke with created a strategy
guide for playing NBA JAM which included play tips and secret powerups.  The
document was posted on Nerd Net.  At the end of the document he thanked me
for answering some of his questions.

I stand by the concept of including secret features in our games, as I'm sure
you all do, but I now understand and agree that management should be made
aware of all such features.

Once again, I apologize for this bug.  I hope this doesn't become a bigger
issue than it already is, and I don't think it will.  It would be a shame if
this forever tarnishes the success of NBA JAM.

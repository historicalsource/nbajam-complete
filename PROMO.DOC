(V.O.  Narrator)

Williams Electronics is currently working on an arcade based video basketball
game which employs life like digitized graphics.  Our two most recent arcade
hits, Terminator 2 and Super High Impact Football also used this technology.

(Fade in T2 example footage)

(V.O. Jim Greene to create)

(Include commentary on the fact we worked closely with the Production
company and Arnold.  Also mention that we used footage right out of the movie,
and the game has been a spectacular success.)

(Fade to black, start narration, fade in basketball segment)


Segment will show and narrate:


1. Basketball studio session:
	- Show carefully crafted script (papers)
	- Behind the scenes footage of dolly action
	- Actual footage of actors doing moves
	- Actual footage of spectacular dunks - quick cuts of many
	- Make sure we show all 4 actors

3. This footage is then digitized:
	- WTARG: Artist at workstation grabbing footage from
 	  master tapes.  A dunk sequence.
	- WIMP: Artist (Differen guy) animating footage that has
	  been grabbed.  A dunk sequence.
	
4. Artwork into video game:
	- Artwork now sent to programmers.
	- Show court/crowd/reflections
	- Show players scaling into background
	- NBC type scoring artwork

Things to narrate:
 - Already blows away any other basketball video games ever done.  Home or
   arcade.
 - Four player game
 - Real speech calling the play by play action.
 - 2 on 2
 - Broadcast T.V. look
 - What you are about to see is 25% complete and very rough
 - Windows will pop up:
	- Replays
	- Commentary from coaches
 - Cut away to other cameras like T.V.:
	- On dunks
	- On long 3 point shots
	- On free throws
 - Special helmet-cam footage when a player goes in on a breakaway dunk 
 - Big team of people working on game - like 10!


If Williams is granted an NBA license, we would:
 - Include all the NBA teams and any player names the NBA allows us to use and
   let the players choose their teams
 - Real NBA footage could be included in our pop up windows
 - Real names could be used in the play by play announcing
 - We would make sure the rules were regulation rules
 - Use the NBA and team logos accordingly
	- Cabinet
	- Court
	- Team uniforms





Other points/notes to make in narration:
 - #1 producer of coin operated amusement games
 - Addams Family, T2, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Gilligan, Twilight Zone, etc.
   This should communicate that we are a heavy hitter.
 - Do a time log which is included with tape
 - What else?
